# Given a list of time intervals, find if any of them overlap.

# For example,
# Intervals -> [5,7], [1,3], [6,9] -> Intervals [5,7] and [6,9] overlap, so we return true


# -----------------------------------------------------

# Medium

# Given a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. 
# At the end of the merge, there should be no overlapping intervals.

# For example:
# Input = (1,3), (3,5), (6,8), (7,9)
# Output = (1,5), (6,9)

# You are given a list of buildings that are part of a skyline. For each building, you
# are given the height, start and end points.

# For example, if a building has [height=5, start=1, end=4],
# it represents a building of height 5 from point 1 on a number line to point 4.
