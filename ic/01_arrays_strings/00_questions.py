# Given an array of numbers, replace each even number with two of the same number. 

# e.g, [1,2,5,6,8, , , ] -> [1,2,2,5,6,6,8,8].

# Assume that the array has the exact amount of space to accommodate the result.

# Given a sentence, reverse the words of the sentence. 

# For example, "i live in a house" becomes "house a in live i".

# Given an array, reverse the order of its elements.

# For example, [3,5,2,5,2,3,9] -> [9,3,2,5,2,5,3]

# 2 Sum Problem: Given a sorted array of integers, find two numbers in the array that sum
# to a given integer target.

# For example, if a = [1,2,3,5,6,7] and target = 11, the answer will be 5 and 6.

# Given a sorted array in non-decreasing order, return an array of squares of each number, 
# also in non-decreasing order. 

# For example, [-4,-2,-1,0,3,5] -> [0,1,4,9,16,25]

# How can you do it in O(n) time?

# Given an array of integers, find the continuous subarray, which when sorted, results in the 
# entire array being sorted. 

# For example: A = [0,2,3,1,8,6,9], result is the subarray [2,3,1,8,6]

# [1,2,4,5,3,5,6,7] -> [4,5,3] 
# [1,3,5,2,6,4,7,8,9] -> [3,5,2,6,4]

# You are given an array of integers. Rearrange the array so that all zeroes are at
# the beginning of the array.

# For example, [4,2,0,1,0,3,0] -> [0,0,0,4,1,2,3]


# -----------------------------------------------------

# You are given an array of integers and a pivot. Rearrange the array in the following order:
# [all elements less than pivot, elements equal to pivot, elements greater than pivot]

# For example, a = [5,2,4,4,6,4,4,3] and pivot = 4 -> result = [3,2,4,4,4,4,5,6]
