# An image is a square matrix of pixels. Rotate a square image by 90 degrees, given an array of
# pixels as integers.

# For example,

# 1 2 3     7 4 1
# 4 5 6  â†’  8 5 2
# 7 8 9     9 6 3

# Check if a String is a rotation of another. 

# For example,
# ["canada", "dacana"] -> true
# ["canada", "canada"] -> true
# ["canada", "canary"] -> false

# You are given a number in the form of an array. Each digit in the array represents a digit in 
# the number. For example, 100 -> [1,0,0]. Perform addition of 2 such number arrays. 

# For example:
# [1,1,1,1] + [2,2,3,3] = [3,3,4,4]
# [9,9] + [1] = [1,0,0]
# [1,6,4,3] + [1,3,1] = [1,7,7,4]

# Multiply two numbers given as Big Integers. In such an array, each element in the array 
# is a single digit number.

# For example:
# [1,6,4,3] * [1,3,1] = [2,1,5,2,3,3]
