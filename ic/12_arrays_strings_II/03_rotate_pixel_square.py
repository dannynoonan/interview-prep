# An image is a square matrix of pixels. Rotate a square image by 90 degrees, given an array of
# pixels as integers.

# For example,

# 1 2 3     7 4 1
# 4 5 6  â†’  8 5 2
# 7 8 9     9 6 3

    [ 5, 6, 7, 8],
    [ 9,10,11,12],
    [13,14,15,16] 
]

# Expected Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of elements in 2D array
# Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
