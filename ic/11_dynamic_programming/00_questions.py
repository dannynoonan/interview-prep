# Climbing Steps Problem

# Letâ€™s say you have to climb N steps. You can jump 1 step, 3 steps or 5 steps at a time. How
# many ways are there to get to the top of the steps.

# Bottom Up Approach using Tabulation

# Longest Increasing Subsequence: Given an array of integers, find the length of the 
# longest increasing subsequence.

# For e.g, in [1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 5, 6], the longest increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] 
# of length 5.

# Coin Change - Print Count: Given a set of coin denominations, print out the number of ways
# you can make a target amount. You can use as many coins of each denomination as you like.

# For example: If coins are [1,2,5] and the target is 5, the different ways are:
# [1,1,1,1,1]
# [1,1,1,2]
# [1,2,2]
# [5]

# The Output will be 4.

# Note: In the Recursion Section, we looked at the Coin Change Problem where we printed each
# combination. If we just need to output the number of combinations, we can do it faster using DP.
