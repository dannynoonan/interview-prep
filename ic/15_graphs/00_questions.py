# Clone a Graph: Given an directed graph, make a copy.

# Hint: The trick here is to maintain a map of old nodes to their corresponding new nodes. 
# This will ensure that any cycles are handled.

# Note: This can be solved with either DFS or BFS.

# Print Graph in Level Order: Given a graph and a node N, print the Graph in order of distance
# from N. Each level should be in a new line.

# For example,
# All nodes of distance 1 from N
# All nodes of distance 2 from N, etc.

# Similar Problem: Print a tree in level order

# Word Ladder Problem: You are given 2 words A and B, both of the same length. Your task is to 
# transform one word to another changing only one letter each time. Each intermediate word should 
# be a valid word in the dictionary. Print out the length of the path. 

# (Alternate version: print out the intermediate words)

# A = CAB, B = DOG
# Result: 4 (CAB -> COB -> COG -> DOG)
