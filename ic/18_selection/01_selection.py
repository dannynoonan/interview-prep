# Selection Algorithm: Find the Kth smallest element in a given array of integers.

# For example,
# If A => [5,7,4,6,5,3,3] and K => 3, the result will be 4

# This is also known as the Kth order statistic of the array.

# Time Complexity: O(n) average case, O(n^2) worst case
# Space Complexity: O(log(n)) average case, O(n) worse case. Space is used on the recursion stack
