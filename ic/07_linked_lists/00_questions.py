# Odd Even Linked List: Given a Linked List L, separate it into 2 Linked Lists. 
# One contains L's odd nodes and the other contains L's even nodes. For example:

# Input: Head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

# Result 1: Head -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
# Result 2: Head -> 2 -> 4

# Note: Odd and Even here refer to the node's position, not value.

# Given a linked list and pointers to a node N and its previous node Prev, delete N from
# the linked list.

# Find if a given Linked List has a cycle

# 04
# Medium

# Given a linked list that has a cycle, find the length of the cycle. The length is in
# number of nodes.

# Find the median node of a linked list. For example:

# 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5      Median node is 3.

# Smallest Subarray Covering All Values: 
# Let's say you are given a large text document Doc. You are also given a set S of words. 
# You want to find the smallest substring of Doc that contains all the words in S. For example:

# S: ["and", "of", "one"]

# Doc: "a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate,
# conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and
# sometimes one or more subordinate clauses"

# Solution: "of a main clause and sometimes one" 

# Note that the order in which the words appear doesn't matter. 
# Also, the length of the substring is in terms of number of characters.

# Reverse a singly-linked list. You should use O(1) space.

# Is Palindrome: Given a Linked List, determine if it is a Palindrome. 
# For example, the following lists are palindromes:
# A -> B -> C -> B -> A
# A -> B -> B -> A
# K -> A -> Y -> A -> K
# R A C E C A R

# Note: Can you do it with O(N) time and O(1) space? (Hint: Reverse a part of the list)

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
