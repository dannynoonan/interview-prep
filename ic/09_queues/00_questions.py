# Given an array of integers A, find the sum of each sliding window of size K.

# Variation: Instead of an array, what if you were presented with a stream of numbers. A new number
# can be added anytime. You want to find the sum of the last K elements.

# Note: The above problem can be solved without a Queue as well - just maintain a sum with 2
# pointers. However, a queue is needed for the Variation problem. We use this problem to illustrate
# the sliding window concept

# You are given stock prices and the corresponding day of each stock price.

# For example:
# (32, 1), (45, 1), (37,2), (42,3), ..

# Here, 32 is the price and 1 is the day of the price.

# Say you are given these prices as an input stream. You should provide a function for
# the user to input a stock price and day. Your system should be able to tell
# the maximum stock price in the last 3 days.

# Maximum of Sliding Window: Given an array A and an integer K, find the maximum element in each 
# sliding window of size K. For example:

# A = [4,6,5,2,4,7] and K = 3, windows are as follows:

# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 6
# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 6
# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 5
# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 7

# Output: 6,6,5,7

# Hint: You can do this in O(n) time, by using the Queue with Max we implemented above
