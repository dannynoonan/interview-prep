# Implement the Delete operation in a Binary Search Tree, i.e, given a BST and a node, 
# delete the node from the BST.


# -----------------------------------------------------

# Note​: It is unlikely that you will be asked this in an interview. So it’s ok to not practice
# the code. However, this is something basic taught in data structure courses, so you should
# know the algorithm behind it. Most of it is pretty easy, except for the ​delete​ function.
