# You are given an array of numbers. Find a number that occurs more than half the time.

# For example, 
# A => [4,2,3,4,4,5,4,4,5,4,4], Result is 4
# A => [2,4,6,6,3,6,7,9,5,3], There is no result because there is no majority

# You are given an array of numbers. Find a number that occurs more than 1/K of the time.

# For example:
# A = [2,4,5,2,4,2,2,1,5] and K = 3, Result = 2, which occurs more than Length/3 times.
# B = [2,4,5,2,4,2,6,1,5] and K = 3, No result as there is no number occurring > Length/3 times.
