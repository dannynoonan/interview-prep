# Given a sorted array, search for a target item.


# -----------------------------------------------------

# 02
# Easy

# Given a sorted array that can contain duplicates, find the first occurrence of the
# target element. 

# For example: [1,3,4,6,6,6,7] and Target = 6, return index 3


# -----------------------------------------------------

# 03

# Given a sorted array A and a target T, return the index where the target would be placed
# if inserted in order.
#
# For example,
# A = [1,2,4,4,5,6,8] and T = 3, return index 2
# A = [1,2,4,4,5,6,8] and T = 0, return index 0
# A = [1,2,4,4,5,6,8] and T = 4, return index 4 (insert after other 4’s).

# 04

# Given a sorted array of Integers, find the target. If the target is not found,
# return the element closest to the target.

# For example,
# A = [1,2,4,5,7,8,9], Target = 6 -> Output Index = 3 or 4 (since both 5 and 7 are equally close)


# -----------------------------------------------------

# 05

# Given an array that is cyclically sorted, find the minimum element. A cyclically sorted
# array is a sorted array rotated by some number of elements. Assume all elements are unique.

# For example:
# A = [4,5,1,2,3], which is just [1,2,3,4,5] rotated by 2. Result = index 2


# -----------------------------------------------------

# 06

# Find the square root of an integer X. For example, squareRoot(4) = 2. 
# It is ok to find the integer floor of the square root. 
# So squareRoot(5) or squareRoot(8) can also return 2. squareRoot(9) will return 3.


# -----------------------------------------------------

# 07

# A peak element in an array A is an A[i] where its neighboring elements are less than A[i].
# So, A[i - 1] < A[i] and A[i + 1] < A[i].
# Assume there are no duplicates. Also, assume that A[-1] and A[length] are negative infinity (-∞).
# So A[0] can be a peak if A[1] < A[0].
# A = [1,3,4,5,2] => Peak = 5
# A = [5,3,1] => Peak = 5
# A = [1,3,5] => Peak = 5
