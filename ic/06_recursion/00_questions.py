# Find the nth number in the Fibonacci series. Fibonacci series is as follows:
# 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ..
# After the first two 1’s, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

# Power Function: Implement a function to calculate X^N. Both X and N can be positive or negative. 
# You can assume that overflow doesn't happen.

# Try doing it in ​O(log(N))​ time

# For example: 
# 2 ^ 2  = 4 
# 2 ^ -2 = 0.25
# -2 ^ 3  = -8

# Phone Number Mnemonics: Given an N digit phone number, print all the strings that can
# be made from that phone number. Since 1 and 0 don't correspond to any characters, ignore 
# them.

# For example:
# 213 => AD, AE, AF, BD, BE, BF, CE, CE, CF
# 456 => GJM, GJN, GJO, GKM, GKN, GKO,.. etc.

# Given an array of integers A, print all its subsets.

# For example:
# Input: [1, 2, 3]
# Output:
# []
# [1]
# [2]
# [3]
# [1, 2]
# [1, 3]
# [2, 3]
# [1, 2, 3]

# Given an array A, print all permutations of size X.

# For example,
# Input:
# A = [1,2,3]
# X = 2
# Output:
# [1, 2]
# [1, 3]
# [2, 1]
# [2, 3]
# [3, 1]
# [3, 2]

# Coin Change Problem: Given a set of coin denominations, print out the different ways you can 
# make a target amount. You can use as many coins of each denomination as you like.

# For example: If coins are [1,2,5] and the target is 5, output will be:
# [1,1,1,1,1]
# [1,1,1,2]
# [1,2,2]
# [5]

# Maze Problem: You are given a 2D array that represents a maze. 
# It can have 2 values - 0 and 1.
# 1 represents a wall and 0 represents a path.
# The objective is to reach the bottom right corner, i.e, A[A.length-1][A.length-1]. 
# You start fromA[0][0]. You can move in 4 directions - up, down, left and right. 
# Find if a path exists to thebottom right of the maze.

# For example, a path exists in the following maze:
# 0 1 1 1
# 0 1 1 1
# 0 0 0 0
# 1 1 1 0

# Word Break Problem: Given a String S, which contains letters and no spaces, find 
# if it can be broken it into valid words. Return one such combination of words. 
# Assume you are provided a dictionary of English words.

# For example:
# S = "ilikemangotango"
# Output: any one of the following:
# "i like mango tango"
# "i like man go tan go"
# "i like mango tan go"
# "i like man go tango"
